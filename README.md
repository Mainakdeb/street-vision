### Project in short  ✨  
The goal of the project is to generate valuable insights from the public surveillance videos and store them in a comfortable CSV record dependent on time and frames. The collected insights can be presented in any comfortable way like a dashboard or can be used for analysing data for future developments in the area under surveillance in terms of traffic control, accident prevention, road expansion etc.,
